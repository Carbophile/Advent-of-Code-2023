# [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023)
*"It's beginning to look a lot like ~~Christmas~~ <img src="https://nodejs.org/static/images/logo.svg" height=20 alt="Node.js">"*

---
Welp, it's that time of the year again. Time to get into the holiday spirit and solve some puzzles. This year, I'm going to be using vanilla Node.js to solve the puzzles.

### Artilery
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript runtime
- [Jetbrains WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) - IDE
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (Duh) - Version control
- Default Android Alarm Clock - I gotta wake up at 6 AM somehow

### Are the solutions any good?
They work..................Yeah, that's about it. I mean, they're fun to read at least. (If you can understand them, that is)

### How do I run the solutions?

1. **Open your bash terminal** *(if you use anything else, you are objectivity wrong and I am revoking your permission to use this code)*:
2. **Clone the repo**:
    ```bash
    git clone
    ```
3. **Navigate to the day you want to run** *(Day 1 for me)*:
    ```bash
    cd day1
    ```
4. **Run the script**:
    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```
5. **Enjoy the output** *(but you won't enjoy the code)*
## FAQ

**Q: Do you have a life?**

A: Next question, please.

**Q: Do you really wake up at 6 AM to solve these puzzles?**

A: Yes. I'm not even a morning person.
## Contributing

Why would you contribute to someone else's Advent of Code repo? Go make your own, weirdo.

## Final Words

If you made it this far into the README, I have a secret for you, the code isn't even that bad and there are some really creative solutions. Do honestly give it a look if you have the time.
